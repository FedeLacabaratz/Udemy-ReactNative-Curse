# BISTRO APP

## Introduction

This application allows users (by using the React Native App) to interact with a database created with MongoDB working through a server made with Apollo and GraphQL.

This app basically allows users to sign up, or log in and then manage projects and tasks by creating, reading, updating and deleting this tasks. This is a Full Stack project and has two phases.

`If you want to clone this repo and put this app to test, please bare in mind that you will need to add a file inside the firebase folder of each side of this project (both web client and React Native App) called "config.js" in which you will add your Database configuration information provided by your own Cloud Firestore in your Firebase. (See Picture down below at the end of this README file)`

## The Back End (made with MongoDB, Apollo and GraphQL)

In here you will find mostly the data base and how I've created a server with apollo for further use with my client side app made with React Native.

## The Front End (made with React Native, Native Base)

In here users will be able to perform CRUD operations once they are logged inside the app.

### .env files

This project is protected with env files so you will have to create your own DB with MongoDB and you secret word, and then configurate you .env file in order to make it work. A link to the full size screens of the entire up is being left for your down below. I hope you enjoy it!
